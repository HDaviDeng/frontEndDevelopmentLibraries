    1. Create a Bootstrap Headline

    Now let's build something from scratch to practice our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills.

    We'll build a jQuery playground, which we'll soon put to use in our jQuery challenges.

    To start with, create an h3 element, with the text jQuery Playground.

    Color your h3 element with the text-primary Bootstrap class, and center it with the text-center Bootstrap class.
-->

<!--
    2. House our page within a Bootstrap container-fluid div

    Now let's make sure all the content on your page is mobil-responsive.

    Let's nest your h3 element within a div element with the class container-fluid.
-->

<!--
    3. Create a Bootstrap Row

    Now we'll create a bootstrap row for our inline elements

    Create a di element below the h3 tag, with a class of row
-->

<!--
    4. Split Your Bootstrap Row

    Now that we have a Bootstrap Row, let's split it into two columns to house our elements.

    Create two div elements within your row, both with the class col-xs-6.
-->

<!--
    5. Create Bootstrap Wells

    Bootstrap has a class called "well" that can create a visual sense of depth for your columns.

    Nest one div element with the class well within each of your col-xs-6 div elements.
-->

<!--
    6. Add elements within your Bootstrap Wells

    Now we're several div elements deep on each column of our row. This is as deep as we'll need to go. Now we can add our button elements.

    Nest three button elements within each of your div elements having the class name well.
-->

<!--
    7. Apply the Default Bootstrap Button Style

    Bootstrap has another button class called btn-default.

    Apply both the btn and btn-default classes to each of your button elements.
-->
