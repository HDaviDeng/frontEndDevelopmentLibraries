    1. Create a Bootstrap Headline

    Now let's build something from scratch to practice our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills.

    We'll build a jQuery playground, which we'll soon put to use in our jQuery challenges.

    To start with, create an h3 element, with the text jQuery Playground.

    Color your h3 element with the text-primary Bootstrap class, and center it with the text-center Bootstrap class.

<!--
    2. House our page within a Bootstrap container-fluid div

    Now let's make sure all the content on your page is mobil-responsive.

    Let's nest your h3 element within a div element with the class container-fluid.
-->

<!--
    3. Create a Bootstrap Row

    Now we'll create a bootstrap row for our inline elements

    Create a di element below the h3 tag, with a class of row
-->

<html>
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h3 class="text-primary text-center">jQuery Playground</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        
    </div>
</html>
