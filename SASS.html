    SASS, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds feeatures that aren't available in basic CSS, which make it easier for you to simplify and maintain the style sheets for your projects.

    In this Sass course, you'll learn how to store data in variables, nest CSS, create reusable styles with mixins, add logic and loops to your styles, and more.

    1. Store Data with Sass Variables

    One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables. They are declared and set to store date, similar to JavaScript.

    In JacaScript, variables aredefined using the let and const keywords. In Sass, variables start with a $ followed by the variable name.

    Here are a couple examples:

    $main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
    $headings-color: green;

    and to use the variables:

    h1 {
        font-family: $main-fonts;
        color: $headings-color;
    }

    One example where variables are useful is when a number of elements need to be the same color. If that color is changed, the only place to edit the code is the variable value.

    Create a variable $text-color and set it to red. Then change the value of the color property for the .blog-post and h2 to the $text-color variable.
-->

<style type='text/scss'>

    $text-color: red;

    .header{
      text-align: center;
    }
    .blog-post, h2 {
      color: $text-color;
    }
  </style>
  
  <h1 class="header">Learn Sass</h1>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Some random title</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph with some random text in it</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Header #2</h2>
    <p>Here is some more random text.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Here is another header</h2>
    <p>Even more random text within a paragraph</p>
  </div>

  <!--
    2. Nest CSS with Sass

    Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.

    Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:

    nav {
        background-color: red;
    }

    nav ul {
        list-style: none;
    }

    nav ul li {
        display: inline-block;
    }

    For a large project, the CSS file will have many lines and rules. This in where nesting can help organize your code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:

    nav {
        background-color: red;

        ul {
            list-style: none;

            li {
                display: inline-block;
            }
        }
    }

    Use the nesting technique shown above to reorganize the CSS rules for both children of .blog-post element. For testing purposes, the h1 should come before the p element.

  <style type='text/scss'>
    .blog-post {
        h1 {
            text-align: center;
            color: blue;
        }
        p {
            font-size: 20px;
        }
    }
    
  </style>
  
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h1>Blog Title</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </div>
