<!--
    SASS, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds feeatures that aren't available in basic CSS, which make it easier for you to simplify and maintain the style sheets for your projects.

    In this Sass course, you'll learn how to store data in variables, nest CSS, create reusable styles with mixins, add logic and loops to your styles, and more.

<!--
    1. Store Data with Sass Variables

    One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables. They are declared and set to store date, similar to JavaScript.

    In JacaScript, variables aredefined using the let and const keywords. In Sass, variables start with a $ followed by the variable name.

    Here are a couple examples:

    $main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
    $headings-color: green;

    and to use the variables:

    h1 {
        font-family: $main-fonts;
        color: $headings-color;
    }

    One example where variables are useful is when a number of elements need to be the same color. If that color is changed, the only place to edit the code is the variable value.

    Create a variable $text-color and set it to red. Then change the value of the color property for the .blog-post and h2 to the $text-color variable.
-->

<style type='text/scss'>

    $text-color: red;

    .header{
      text-align: center;
    }
    .blog-post, h2 {
      color: $text-color;
    }
  </style>
  
  <h1 class="header">Learn Sass</h1>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Some random title</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph with some random text in it</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Header #2</h2>
    <p>Here is some more random text.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Here is another header</h2>
    <p>Even more random text within a paragraph</p>
  </div>

<!--
    2. Nest CSS with Sass

    Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.

    Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:

    nav {
        background-color: red;
    }

    nav ul {
        list-style: none;
    }

    nav ul li {
        display: inline-block;
    }

    For a large project, the CSS file will have many lines and rules. This in where nesting can help organize your code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:

    nav {
        background-color: red;

        ul {
            list-style: none;

            li {
                display: inline-block;
            }
        }
    }

    Use the nesting technique shown above to reorganize the CSS rules for both children of .blog-post element. For testing purposes, the h1 should come before the p element.
  -->

  <style type='text/scss'>
    .blog-post {
        h1 {
            text-align: center;
            color: blue;
        }
        p {
            font-size: 20px;
        }
    }
    
  </style>
  
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h1>Blog Title</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </div>

  <!--
    3. Create Reusable CSS with Mixins

    In Sass, a mixin is a group of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout the style sheet.

    Newer CSS features take time before they are fully adopted and ready to use in all browsers. As features are added to browsers, CSS rules using them may need vendor prefixes. Consider box-shadow:

    div {
        -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
        -moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
        -ms-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
        }

    It's a lot of typing to re-write this rule for all the elements that have a box-shadow, or to change each value to test different effects. Mixins are like functions for CSS. Here is how to write one:

    @mixin box-shadow($x, $y, $blur, $c) {
        -webkit-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
        -moz-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
        -ms-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
        box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
    }

    The definition starts with @mixin followed by a custome name. The parameters (the $x, $y, $blur, and $c in the example above) are optional. Now any time a box-shadow rule is needed, only a single line calling the mixin replaces having to type all the vendor prefixes. A mixin is called with the @include directive:

    div {
        @include box-shadow(0px, 0px, 4px, #fff);
    }

    Write a mixin for border-radius and give it a $radius parameter. It should use all the vendor prefixes from the example. Then use the border-radius mixin to gibve the #awesome element a border radius of 15px.
  -->



  <style type='text/scss'>



    #awesome {
      width: 150px;
      height: 150px;
      background-color: green;
  
    }
  </style>
  
  <div id="awesome"></div>


<!--
    4. Use @if and @else to Add Logic To Your Styles

    The @if directive in Sass is useful to test for a specific case - it works just like the if statement in JavaScript.

    @mixin make-bold($bool) {
        @if $bool == true {
            font-weight: bold;
        }
    }

    And just like in JavaScript, the @else if and @else directives test for more conditions:

    @mixin text-effect($val) {
        @if $val == danger {
            color: red;
        }
        @else if $val == alert {
            color: yellow;
        }
        @else if $val == success {
            color: green;
        }
        @else {
            color: black;
        }
    }

    Create a mixin called border-stroke that takes a parameter $val. The mixin should check for the following conditions using @if, @else if, and @else directives:

    light - 1px solid black
    medium - 3px solid black
    heavy - 6px solid black

    If the $val parameter value is not light, medium, or heavy, then the border property should be set to none.
-->

<style type='text/scss'>



    #box {
      width: 150px;
      height: 150px;
      background-color: red;
      @include border-stroke(medium);
    }
  </style>
  
  <div id="box"></div>


<!--
5. Use @for to Create a Sass Loop

The @for directive adds styles in a loop, bery similar to a for loop in JavaScript.

@fir is used in two ways:"start through end" or "start to end". The main difference is that the "start to end" excludes the end number as part of the count, and "start through end" includes the end number as part of the count.

Here's a start through end example:

@for $i from 1 through 12 {
    .col-#{$i} {
        width: 100%/12 * $i;
    }
}

The #{$1} part is the syntac to combine a variable (i) with text to make a string. When the Sass file is converted to CSS, it looks like this:

.col-1 {
  width: 8.33333%;
}

.col-2 {
  width: 16.66667%;
}

...

.col-12 {
  width: 100%;
}

This is a powerful way to create a grid layout. Now you hace twelve options for column widths available as CSS classes.

Write a @for directive that takes a variable $j that goes from 1 to 6.

It should create 5 classes called .text-1 to .text-5 where each has a font-size set to 15px multiplied by the index.
-->

<!--
    Guideline from SASS Guideline

    The @for loop might be useful when combined with CSS':nth-* pseudo-classes. Except for these scenarios, prefer an @each loop if you hace to iterate over something.

    @for $i from 1 through 10 {
        .foo:nth-of-type(#{$i}) {
            border-color: hsl($i * 36, 50%, 50%);
        }
    }

    Always use $i as a variable name to stick to the usual convention and unless you hace a really good reason to, never use tht to keyword: always use through. Many decelopers do not even know SASS offers this variation; using it might lead to confusion.

    Also be sure to respect those guidlines to preserve readability:

    Always an empty new line before @for;
    Always an empty new line after the closing brace(}) unless the next line is a closing brace(}).
-->

<style type='text/scss'>
    @for $j from 1 through 6 {
      .text-#{$j} {
        font-size: 15px * $j;
      }
    }
    
    </style>
    
    <p class="text-1">Hello</p>
    <p class="text-2">Hello</p>
    <p class="text-3">Hello</p>
    <p class="text-4">Hello</p>
    <p class="text-5">Hello</p>
